There are two simple steps to point a GoDaddy domain to an EC2 instance — create an elastic IP for that EC2 instance you are integrating, and connect the elastic IP to your domain.
<!--truncate-->

* Create an elastic IP for the EC2 instance you are integrating.
  * Click Allocate new address in the Elastic IPs page.
  * Then, click Allocate in the next page.
  * Right-click the row of the newly created elastic IP, and click Associate address.
  * Choose the EC2 instance you are integrating.

* Connect the elastic IP to your domain.
  * Go to GoDaddy’s Domain Manager.
  * Go to the Manage DNS of the domain you are integrating.
  * Replace the Value of record with Type A with the elastic IP you just created.
  * Wait for changes to reflect (This takes at least 600 seconds to reflect, depending on the TTL you specified).
  * To check if successful, the domain should now load the EC2 instance you pointed it too.
